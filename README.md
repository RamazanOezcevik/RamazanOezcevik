I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Mechatronics and Automotive Engineering (M. Sc.) while working part-time in the industry. 
I have hands-on experience with STM32 microcontroller programmingâ€”including TCP/UDP server development, CAN, I2C, UART, and RTOS applications.
In Python, I enjoy developing custom tools and tackling data processing, analysis, and machine learning projects.
